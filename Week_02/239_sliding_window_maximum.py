        largest element of the rest of the list. For example:
            nums = [1, 2, 7, 5, 6, 4], k = 2
        when windows gets to [7, 5], the largest element is 7, deque = [2, 3], we add 7 to result
        now when we go to next element 6, the window will become [7,6] instead of [5, 6], we will continue
        to add 7, (i=4)
        When this will happen? This happens when i-k = window[0], which is 4-2 = 2, and window[0] = 2.
        So when this happens, we need to pop left.
